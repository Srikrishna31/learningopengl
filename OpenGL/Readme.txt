This project is a simple exploration of OpenGL capabilities.

It relies on the following 3rd party libraries (that are checked into the source):
1. freeglut-3.0.0  : Provides cross platform windowing toolkit, to explore OpenGL without the headache of choosing one.
2. glew-2.0.0: A library that allows to query the version and other capabilities of underlying OpenGL implementation.
3. glm: A simple math library, that mimics GLSL style functions, so that matrix manipulations are easy.
